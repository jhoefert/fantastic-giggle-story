	Hoefert story x4

	In the year 1887, there lived a dog named Spot. Spot was a golden retriever, and had no spots to speak of. Spot wasn't happy to have such 
a confusing name. Spot was eight years old at this point, having lived most of his life on a farm in the middle of Arkansas. The farm was maintained 
by Spot's owners, Mr. and Mrs. Abernathy, and their blind child, Timmy. Throughout the year, the Abarnathys would tend to their fields,
and Spot would watch over Timmy and chase of the predators that would come for their livestock. It was a simple life, but enough to keep Spot happy.
It would have been a dream come true to live out his life on this farm, with the Abernathys, and helping out in any way he could. Spot had no idea
of how his life would change in just a few short days.
