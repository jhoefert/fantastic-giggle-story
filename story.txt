	Hoefert story x4

	In the year 1887, there lived a dog named Spot. Spot was a golden retriever, and had no spots to speak of. Spot wasn't happy to have such 
a confusing name. Spot was eight years old at this point, having lived most of his life on a farm in the middle of Arkansas. The farm was maintained 
by Spot's owners, Mr. and Mrs. Abernathy, and their blind child, Timmy. Throughout the year, the Abarnathys would tend to their fields,
and Spot would watch over Timmy and chase of the predators that would come for their livestock. It was a simple life, but enough to keep Spot happy.
It would have been a dream come true to live out his life on this farm, with the Abernathys, and helping out in any way he could. Spot had no idea
of how his life would change in just a few short days.
	One day, a limo came to visit the Abernathy's farm. A man dressed in fancy clothest stepped out. He came to the door of their house and knocked loud enough for the next farm over to hear. "Hello is anyone home?" the man asked. "I need to talk to you about an opportunity for Spot!" the man yelled with enthusiasm.  Mrs. Abernathy came to the door. "Hi, how may I help you?" she asked. "Hey Mr.s Abernathy, my name is Todd, I am the manager for the world's most famous cat that you see in every commercial. I wanted to talk to you about an opportunity that has oppened up that I feel Spot here can fill up very nicely! The only thing is that he will have to move to Vegas for a year." Mrs. Abernathy was left speechless.
